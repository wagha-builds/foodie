        <p>Biryani is more than just a dish; it's an emotion. Originating from Persia and perfected in the royal kitchens of the Mughals, Biryani has traveled a long way to become India's favorite dish.</p>
        <h3>The Origins</h3>
        <p>The word 'Biryani' comes from the Persian word 'Birian', which means 'fried before cooking'. It was originally a dish for the army, providing a balanced meal of rice, meat, and spices.</p>
        <h3>Regional Varieties</h3>
        <p>From the spicy Hyderabadi Dum Biryani to the aromatic Lucknowi version, and the potato-loving Kolkata Biryani, every region in India has added its own twist to this classic.</p>

        <p>Eating healthy doesn't mean burning a hole in your pocket. With a little planning and smart choices, you can maintain a nutritious diet on a budget.</p>
        <h3>1. Buy Seasonal</h3>
        <p>Seasonal fruits and vegetables are not only fresher and tastier but also significantly cheaper than off-season produce.</p>
        <h3>2. Cook at Home</h3>
        <p>Ordering out frequently adds up. Preparing simple meals at home gives you control over ingredients and portion sizes while saving money.</p>
        <h3>3. Plant-Based Proteins</h3>
        <p>Lentils, chickpeas, and beans are excellent sources of protein that are much more affordable than meat.</p>
